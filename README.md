his project guides you through building a basic Express.js web server called The Daily Grind. Youâ€™ll begin by setting up a new Node.js project using npm init -y and installing Express as a dependency. Next, you'll create a public folder containing two HTML pages: index.html with a welcoming heading and contact.html with contact information. Then, you'll build your server in a server.js file. The server uses Express to handle GET requests to the root URL (/) and /contact, serving the respective HTML files using the built-in path module to construct absolute file paths. Finally, the server listens on a specified port (e.g., 3000) and logs a confirmation message when it starts. This activity helps you practice setting up a Node.js project, managing dependencies, handling routing, and serving static files using Express.
